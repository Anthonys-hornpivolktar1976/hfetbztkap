Just walked out of the theater after 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 Riff Raff, and man, I'm on a weird kind of high. It's like I've just gotten off a roller coaster and I'm still trying to figure out whether I enjoyed the ride or if I just want to lie down and let my brain stop spinning. Honestly, though, I didn't think I could be entertained while feeling mildly annoyed, but here we are.

I mean, the lead character—what's his name again? That dude never looks like he's quite figured out how to hold himself together, kinda like a paper boat in a rainstorm. He's a mess, but maybe that's the point? My mind's ricocheting between seeing myself in the guy (scary thought, btw) and just wanting him to friggin' get it together already! By the end, I was rooting for him, even if I wanted to scream.

> There's this scene, right, where the bloke is standing in the rain, looking like a dog that just realized it's been chasing its tail for the past hour. You ever see someone show their life's disappointments all at once on their face? That was him—if you'd pluck this moment out, maybe stick it in a bottle, it’d smell just like a wet basement, a bit mildewy but also kinda comforting. 

Anyway, dialogue. Yup, they spoke a lot, I guess. It's like writers throw around lines like they're passing a hot potato, seeing who can make it land before it burns their fingers. Sometimes it worked, other times it was pure huh? moments strung together. Did they ever ask real people how they talk? Maybe I’ll 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   just to catch all the muttered lines.

There was this bit with the music—half the time I didn't know if it was supposed to make me feel buoyant or bury me under a feeling of impending doom. I guess that’s life, huh? Crappy background music and all. And the love interest, bless her heart, feels like she's just walked off the wrong 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 set.

int loyaltyMeter = 0;
for(int i = 0; i < friendshipAttempts; i++) {
    loyaltyMeter += (isKind(toFriend)) ? 1 : -1;
}

Would I suggest someone 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  ? Probably, but more of a you gotta experience this thing than a roaring endorsement. It's not a sit back and relax kind of 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮; you'll find yourself chucking household objects at your screen—mentally, of course. I mean, you'd have to be nuts to wreck your TV like that. But, yeah, give it a go if you feel like getting drenched in someone else's chaos for a bit. ☂️
